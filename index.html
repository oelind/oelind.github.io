            <img src="images/griffin_print.jpeg"  class="img-fluid rounded" alt="Tiger-Falcon-Griffin print">
            <p>This is my latest project (besides this website) which was for the final assignment <br>
                for my print class. The blocks I carved were linolium and used a total of four blocks for this print. <br>
                It has three layers and it took me a few weeks to finish all the carving and I used my own sketches to design the print
            </p>
        </div>
        <br><br><br>
        <div class="col-md-8 pic_then_yap">
            <img src="images/portrait_assignment.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded" alt="My spin on a self portrait assignment">
            <p> This is my spin on our self potrait assignment. It was my first print and while I accidently 
                carved away a bit too much for it to be super clear that it is of myself looping in a mirror.
                I specifically chose to use a refrence photo with me looking in a mirror for my sketch to
                show the contrast of how I am percieved versus how I see myself. There is no mouth on my reflection
                because my voice does not match how I feel inside.

            <img src="images/leaf_mokuhanga.jpeg"  class="img-fluid rounded" alt="A random cool leaf">
            <p>
                This was a mokuhanga print project which is a Japanese style of print making. I also used wood blocks for This
                project (not certain on the type of wood). This print has four layers and is of a leaf I took a photo of this 
                past fall.

            <img src="images/reduction_print.jpeg"  class="img-fluid rounded" alt="Layers: One of the ways the earth records history">
            <p> A reduction print with the them being earth as an element I used my own drawings with some
                inspiration from actual fossils and rock layers. For a reduction print the same block is used for all of the layers
                which means the other layers (not including the final one) cannot be re-done or printed again as more of
                the material of the block has been carved away. In other words the editions of a reduction print are rather exclusive.
                I did three layers and used pine plywood.

            <p>
                This project the theme was to do a nature themed/ inspired pattern and based off of some
                leaves I used my sketch to design the print. This was a single layer print and I used a linolium block.
